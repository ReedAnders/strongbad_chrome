## Strongbad Chrome Extension

A simple chrome extension based on the Gmail chrome extension. After installation, it plays a Strong Bad email sound clip whenever a new email in your Gmail inbox is detected. 

I plan to add more sound clips to be played randomly, in addition to a menu to customize settings. I was not able to find any copyright information related to use of Homestar Runner clips.

### Installation

This extension is only available in Chrome development mode. Instructions on running the app can be found [here](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked).
